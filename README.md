Roadmap to master Oracle db

1. **SQL Basics**: Understanding SQL syntax, data types, operators, functions, and clauses (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc.).
2. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Creating, modifying, and dropping database objects like tables, indexes, views, sequences, and synonyms.
3. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data in tables using SQL statements.
4. **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Writing SELECT queries to retrieve data from one or multiple tables, including joins, subqueries, and set operators.
5. **Transaction Control**: Managing database transactions using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, and SET TRANSACTION statements.
6. **Constraints**: Defining constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints to enforce data integrity.
7. **Indexes**: Creating and managing indexes to improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval operations.
8. **Views**: Creating and managing virtual tables (views) based on SELECT queries to simplify complex queries and enhance security.
9. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Writing and executing stored procedures and functions to encapsulate business logic within the database for reuse and maintainability.
10. **Triggers**: Creating and managing database triggers to automatically execute actions in response to specific database events.
11. **Database Security**: Managing user accounts, roles, and privileges to control access to database objects and ensure data security.
12. **Backup and Recovery**: Performing database backups and restoring data in case of failures using tools like RMAN (Recovery Manager).
13. **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing SQL queries, indexing strategies, and database configuration settings to improve query performance and scalability.
14. **Database Monitoring and Management**: Monitoring database performance, managing resources, and diagnosing and resolving performance issues.
15. **High Availability and Scalability**: Implementing features like Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) and Oracle Data Guard to achieve high availability and scalability.
16. **Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence**: Designing and building data warehouses, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and business intelligence solutions using tools like Oracle OLAP, Oracle Warehouse Builder, and Oracle BI.
17. **Partitioning**: Partitioning large tables and indexes to improve manageability, performance, and availability.
18. **Spatial and Graph Data**: Storing and querying spatial and graph data for applications like GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and social network analysis.
19. **JSON Support**: Working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, including storing, querying, and manipulating JSON documents in the database.
20. **Multitenant Architecture**: Understanding Oracle's multitenant architecture for managing multiple pluggable databases within a single container database.
21. **Cloud Deployment and Management**: Deploying and managing Oracle databases in the cloud using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) or Oracle Autonomous Database services.
